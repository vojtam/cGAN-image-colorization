## üåü Project Overview
I wanted this project to be complete, end-to-end process which goes beyond just training a deep learning model. The goal is to bring the model to user-facing frontend in a scalable and devops-focused way. It takes a grayscale image from a user, uses a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) to add realistic color, and returns the result. The entire system is containerized and deployed on a public Kubernetes cluster using Helm, with automated builds and deployments managed by GitHub Actions.


## üß† The Machine Learning Model

I was following the protocol proposed in the [Pix2Pix paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.07004) for training the Conditional GAN model. The architecture consists of a U-Net generator and a PatchGAN discriminator.

- **Generator:** U-Net architecture with skip connections tasked with generating detailed images.
- **Discriminator:** PatchGAN classifier that determines if `(input, output)` pairs are real or fake.
- **Dataset:** Trained on a 10,000-image subset of the COCO dataset.
